# Shiny-Pokes
This project is a Java GUI Application for tracking your Shiny Pokemon Hunting. 
The project is experimental and might contain minor bugs. GUI is not polished, only a template. Internet connection is also required to access PokeAPI.

Program uses RESTful API to receive a list of every Pokemon and Icon from https://pokeapi.co/
